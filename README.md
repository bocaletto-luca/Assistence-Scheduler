## Description

**Assistence Scheduler** is a complete web application for managing appointments and a client agenda. The app enables you to:

- **Manage Events in Three Views:**
  - **Calendar View:** An interactive calendar (powered by FullCalendar) where you can add, edit, and delete events by clicking on a day.  
  - **List View:** Events are displayed as cards and can be filtered via a search field.  
  - **Year View:** Displays 12 mini-calendars (one per month) showing a full grid of days. If multiple events exist on a day, clicking the day opens a modal with the list of events and provides an option to add a new event for that day.

- **Manage Client Agenda:**
  - Add, edit, and delete clients.
  - Each client has: **Client Name**, **Phone Number**, **Address**, and an **Extra** field.
  - The Agenda tab also includes a search field to filter clients.

- **Global Toolbar for Events:**
  - **Add Event**
  - **Export Events** (in JSON and CSV formats)
  - **Import Events** (from JSON)
  - **Print**
  - **Refresh**

- **Local Persistence:**
  - All data—including Events and Agenda—is saved in `localStorage`.
